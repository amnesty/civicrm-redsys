# CiviCRM Redsys Payment Processor #

Hello,

We have moved the project space for Redsys extension to CiviCRM's Gitlab.
This includes both the issue tracking and support, and merge requests.

The new URL is: https://lab.civicrm.org/extensions/redsys

All issues have been migrated to: https://lab.civicrm.org/extensions/redsys/issues

If you do not already have an account on CiviCRM's Gitlab, you can create an account
by registering on https://civicrm.org/user

Thank you!
